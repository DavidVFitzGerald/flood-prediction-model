# Flood Prediction Model
## Purpose
This project was created to be submitted as Midterm Project for the [Machine Learning Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp) (2025 cohort).

## Problem Description
As reported by the [World Meteorological Organization](https://wmo.int/topics/floods), floods are the deadliest type of natural disaster. Furthermore, the damages caused by flooding have been growing over time in the last decades due to an "increasing frequency of heavy precipitation, changes in upstream land-use and a continuously increasing concentration of population and assets in flood-prone areas" (WMO, n.d.).

Being able to estimate the probability of flooding of an area therefore helps with flood planning and management, as it might help identify measures that could reduce the risk of damages. 

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to estimate the probability of flooding of an area based on various factors. This is achieved by testing various machine learning models and selecting the best-performing one. The selected model is deployed as a service.

## Data
The data for this project is fictitious. It was generated from a deep learning model for a competition hosted on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e5/data). To facilitate reproducibility, the data has been included in the files of this project. The data used for this project is contained in the ```train.csv``` file provided for the [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e5/data) competition.
